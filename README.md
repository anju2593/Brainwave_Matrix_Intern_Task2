Twitter Sentiment Analysis
Social media platforms like Twitter serve as a hub for public opinions, making them a valuable resource for sentiment analysis. This project focuses on Twitter Sentiment Analysis, leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify tweets into different sentiment categories—Positive, Negative, and Neutral.

Using a dataset of tweets, the text data undergoes preprocessing, including text cleaning, tokenization, and stop-word removal. Sentiment classification is then performed using TextBlob for polarity scoring and Logistic Regression as a machine learning model. Additionally, word clouds and hashtag frequency analysis provide insights into common words and themes within positive and negative tweets.


Key aspects covered in this project:

   •	Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Removing special characters, stop words, and unnecessary elements.
   •	Sentiment Classification: Using TextBlob and supervised ML models.
   •	Data Visualization: Word clouds and hashtag frequency distributions for sentiment analysis.
   •	Feature Extraction: Implementing Bag of Words (BoW) for text representation.
   •	Model Training & Evaluation: Using Logistic Regression to classify tweet sentiments.

This analysis helps businesses, researchers, and policymakers understand public opinion trends and make informed decisions based on social media sentiment.
